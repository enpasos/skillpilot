# SkillPilot – Your Personal Learning Navigator

SkillPilot navigates you through complex learning landscapes, modeling curricula as a dependency graph to provide personalized learning paths and track your mastery.

This project is an invitation to the community to jointly build and bring to life a secure platform for learning landscapes—a shared home where learners, educators, curriculum institutions, and supporting AIs alike can thrive.
