# SkillPilot – Your Personal Learning Navigator

SkillPilot navigates you through complex learning landscapes, modeling curricula as a dependency graph to provide personalized learning paths and track your mastery.

This project is an invitation to the community to jointly build and bring to life a secure platform for learning landscapes—a shared home where learners, educators, curriculum institutions, and supporting AIs alike can thrive.

## 🤖 Help Train the Agent!

We do not view the SkillPilot AI Agent as a finished software product, but as an **apprentice**. It is currently learning its job as a trainer. We are currently working on teaching it four essential skills:

1.  **The Right Tone (Chat Persona):** A good trainer doesn't rattle off data. It must learn to speak the learner's language, motivate, and communicate at eye level.
2.  **The Wire to the Base (Backend Interaction):** The agent must not hallucinate who it is talking to. It needs to sync perfectly with "Mission Control". This is a two-way street: the backend communication must also work seamlessly to support the AI.
3.  **Navigating the Jungle (Curriculum):** Curricula are complex. The agent learns to use filters (e.g., "Math Advanced Course") to show a clear path. Simultaneously, we need to adjust the curriculum models to meet the agent's needs.
4.  **The Pedagogical Spark (Didactics):** The supreme discipline. The agent should not give away the answer, but guide. It learns to ask smart counter-questions so that the learner has an "Aha!" moment themselves.
